# Kingdom Come Deliverance

A bike tour in June 2022.

The fantastic PC game Kingdom Come Deliverance was the motivation for this two-day bike tour. But even non-players will enjoy the bike ride through the beautiful, scarcely populated and untouristed landscape. A wounderful off-the-beaten-path experience.

And how much of the game world will you see? I created a Google Earth add-on (based on the map in [this blog post](http://english.edgeoftheworld.cz/2018/02/23/kingdom-come-deliverance-map-compare/):

## Day 1: Český Šternberk - Chocerady

- Ascend (altitude difference): 507 hm (-24 hm)
- [Route](https://bikerouter.de/#map=12/49.8493/14.8813/standard&lonlats=14.929849,49.809199;14.926348,49.808534;14.943509,49.816503;14.945869,49.817718;14.944367,49.828104;14.954109,49.842418;14.95839,49.841961;14.989343,49.857336;14.972895,49.872054;14.955515,49.866534;14.896592,49.876999;14.906827,49.87516;14.895272,49.870222;14.857271,49.888676;14.859513,49.895934;14.845115,49.896113;14.804203,49.870517&pois=14.954646,49.840973,Pirkstein;14.957432,49.842063,Upper%20Castle;14.973858,49.872278,Uzhitz;14.955335,49.866564,Talmberg;14.897367,49.877076,Sasau%20Monastery;14.895243,49.870217,St.%20Martin;14.859567,49.895934,Rovna;14.845075,49.896103,Skalitz&profile=trekking)

East of the train station you have to bypass a bar gate. For the next kilometer, the way is quite rocky - but still manageable with regular bikes. If you still want to avoid this stretch (or shorten the route) you can exit the train at Rataje n.Sáz.zast or Rataje n.Sáz.-Ivaň.

### Sights

- *[Český Šternberk Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8Cesk%C3%BD_%C5%A0ternberk_Castle)*: Great view
- *[Rataje nad Sázavou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rataje_nad_S%C3%A1zavou)*
	- Pirkštejn
	- Castle
- *Church of Užice*: Was closed - if you want to see the inside, check for opening hours
- *Ruins of Castle [Talmberk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmberk)*: If you want to see the ruins, you have to walk past a beekeeper's house. The bees might seem a bit scary, but they are not aggressive. Plus: You can buy honey.
- *[Sázava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1zava_(town))*
	- [Monastery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1zava_Monastery "Sázava Monastery")
	- St. Martin's church
- *Church of Rovná*: Was closed - if you want to see the inside, check for opening hours
- *[Church of Stříbrná Skalice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St%C5%99%C3%ADbrn%C3%A1_Skalice)*

### Food
While it's great that the tour is "off the beaten track", finding a place to eat is tricky. You can have lunch near the train station in Sázava. I strongly recommend to go not too late for dinner in Chocerady (before 19:00h).
## Day 2: Chocerady - Týnec nad Sázavou
