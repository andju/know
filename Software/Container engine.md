# Container engine
Some Software discussed requires a container management software. I recommend either [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/) or [Podman](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2023/09/27/how-install-and-use-podman-desktop-windows).

Since I am using Podman, all commands my examples will start with `podman`. If you are using Docker, just replace this command with `docker` - the rest should work the same.
