The fantastic PC game Kingdom Come Deliverance was the motivation for this two-day bike tour. [KCD bike tour.kmz](https://github.com/andju/andju-know/blob/main/Travel/Bicycle/attachments/KCD bike tour.kmz?raw=true) (which is based on the map in [this blog post](http://english.edgeoftheworld.cz/2018/02/23/kingdom-come-deliverance-map-compare/)) shows which parts of the game world you will see.

But even non-players will enjoy the bike ride through the beautiful, scarcely populated and untouristed landscape. A wonderful off-the-beaten-path experience.

## Day 1: Český Šternberk - Chocerady

East of the train station you have to bypass a bar gate. For the next kilometer, the way is quite rocky - but still manageable with regular bikes. If you still want to avoid this stretch (or shorten the route) you can exit the train at Rataje n.Sáz.zast or Rataje n.Sáz.-Ivaň.

If you want to do a day-trip, take a train from Chocerady back to Prague (1.5 hours).
### Sights

- [Český Šternberk Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8Cesk%C3%BD_%C5%A0ternberk_Castle): Great view
- [Rataje nad Sázavou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rataje_nad_S%C3%A1zavou)
	- Pirkštejn Castle
	- Rataje Castle
- Church of Užice: Was closed - if you want to see the inside, check for opening hours
- Ruins of Castle [Talmberk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmberk): If you want to see the ruins, the path passes by a beekeeper's house. The bees might seem a bit scary, but they are not aggressive. Plus: You can buy honey.
- [Sázava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1zava_(town))
	- [Monastery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1zava_Monastery "Sázava Monastery")
	- St. Martin's church
- [Stříbrná Skalice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St%C5%99%C3%ADbrn%C3%A1_Skalice)
	- Church of Rovná: Was closed - if you want to see the inside, check for opening hours
	- Church of Saint John of Nepomuk: Stands on the former site of the castle

### Food and accommodation
While it's great that the area is untouristed, finding a place to eat can be tricky. You can have lunch near the train station in Sázava and I recommend going for dinner in Chocerady before ~19:00h.

Also accommodations are sparse - but fortunately Hotel Ostende offers good value for the price.

## Day 2: Chocerady - Týnec nad Sázavou

The route continues along the river Sazava.
### Sights
- [Chateau Komorní Hrádek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komorn%C3%AD_Hr%C3%A1dek): Stands on the site of a castle, that was built by Radzig Kobyla. You can only see the outside, since it is used by the military.
- Ruins of Castle Zlenice

### Food
With more populated places along the route, the number of restaurants increases. Be aware though, that your favorite might be closed.

## Alternative route
Initially I planned to overnight in Rataje nad Sázavou, but had to change due to a lack of accommodations. To extend the route to Týnec nad Sázavou was a spontaneous decision.

- Day 1: [Český Šternberk - Rataje nad Sázavou](https://en.mapy.cz/turisticka?planovani-trasy&x=14.9286148&y=49.8279968&z=14&rc=95Yt3xWSos5almPJeos5kbieP5Ch&rs=pubt&rs=ward&rs=coor&rs=muni&ri=15211187&ri=9225&ri=&ri=3819&mrp=%7B%22c%22%3A121%7D&xc=%5B%5D)

## What about Přibyslavice?
A thriving village in "From the Ashes" - today a few ruins: Not much is left of [Přibyslavice](https://mapy.com/en/zakladni?source=base&id=2138786&x=14.8530516&y=49.9141276&z=19). If you are a die-hard KCD fan, feel free to extend the tour (e.g. from [Stříbrná Skalice](https://bikerouter.de/#map=15/49.9063/14.8522/standard&lonlats=14.84637,49.897751;14.855562,49.914261&profile=trekking)). Keep in mind: Since I did not go there, I don't know the quality of the road.

### The past of the extinct settlement of Přibyslavice
Translated from [this site](https://www.hradec1.cz/minulost-zanikle-osady-pribyslavice/) 🇨🇿:

> An interesting part of history are the stories of extinct villages. Stories mostly shortened and twisted over time, yet enticing with their veiled secrets. One such story is brought to us by the extinct settlement of Přibyslavice, located about two kilometers north of Stříbrná Skalica.
> 
> Torso of buildings
> To date, only torso of brick buildings last inhabited during the Second World War have been preserved in Přibyslavice.
> 
> Written sources
> We know roughly the following about the past of Přibyslavice (ie I am based on an article by S. Hendrychová published in Sázavsko No. 13, I only add my own findings in some places):
> 
> - 1436 - they are the property of the Sázava Monastery (believes J. Kurka in his work from 1914 - Archdeaconry of Kouřim, Boleslav, Hradec Králové and Litomyšl Diocese)
> - 1525 - they are pledged to the lord of Šellenberk, the holder of the Komorní Hrádek estate (the data comes from the chronicle of Stříbrná Skalica, which, however, as one of the oldest in the region began to appear at the beginning of the 18th century, ie 200 years later than the above )
> - 1557 - the first unquestionable mention of the village as part of the property of the Komorní Hrádek estate
> - 1654 - two farmers (Berní rula) farm in Přibyslavice
> - 1697 - they become the property of the Kounice estate in the middle of the 18th century - one farmer farms in the village (Tereziánský cadastre)
> - 1761 - Duchess Maria Theresa of Savoy buys the estate of Kounice and Přibyslavice and the village thus becomes part of the Černokostelec estate, to which the town of Skalice has belonged since the 16th century, of which Přibyslavice became a part in the middle of the 19th century
> - mid-19th century - farmed here in No. 82 J. Vysušil (information given in the Indication sketch - J. Wisuschil)
> - 2nd half of the 19th century - the Buriánek family farms here. Sometimes during this period there is a complete reconstruction of the court, which is evident from the map of the stable cadastre from 1842, where the layout of buildings is completely different from the situation still preserved in the field and the situation recorded in the current cadastre (see plan at the end of the article). This change is also captured in the map of the land cadastre, where both the original state and the current state are visible. The reconstruction creates two descriptive numbers: no. 82 and no. 184.
> - 1900 - Suicide of Antonín Buriánek, after which the Buriánek family leaves Přibyslavice and the beginning of the decline of Přibyslavice as a peasant homestead begins. Part of the family of Antonín's brother František then appears in the village of Prusice, a few kilometers away, where he starts farming in No. 2. This is where my wife's mother, née Buriánková, comes from. My wife and my children are descendants of the Buriánky family from Přibyslavice. since the beginning of the 20th century, only forest and forest workers have lived here
> - 1906 - in no. 184 lives of Václav Hirš's family (until 1930)
> - 1922 - dies in no. 82 forest guard Josef Malík
> - 1928 - no. 82 referred to as the princely grove - gamekeeper Alois Navrátil
> - 1928 - no. 184 referred to as the prince's house
> - 1931 - in no. 184 lives the family of František Pavel
> - 1932 - the last mention in the registers of no. 82 during World War II they live in Přibyslavice Jón
> - 1945 - František Kroupa dies - the last person with permanent residence in Přibyslavice, which does not mean that he actually had to live here
> - today - property of the School Forest Enterprise with its registered office in Kostelec n. No. l.
> 
> As can be seen from the list of data, we have not preserved much about this extinct medieval village, later the settlement and recently in solitude, so it is necessary to constantly remember these fragments. If you would like to learn more about Přibyslavice, get the publication Sázavsko number 13, where the above-mentioned article by Soni Hendrychová is published, or visit the current Přibyslavice straight away. One never knows whether he will see what he sees today in a few years. An example is the experience of the author of the article, who did the first prospection of Přibyslavice in 2006, when it could be noticed in the field disproportionately more than a year later, when the forest road passing through the settlement was extended from two to four meters and objects a year ago buried.
