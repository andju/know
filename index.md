Welcome to my digital garden!

## What is a digital garden?

According to [Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up):

> A digital garden is an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, where digital gardeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public. Contrary to a blog, where articles and essays have a publication date and start decaying as soon as they are published, a digital garden is evergreen: digital gardeners keep on editing and refining their notes.

I see a digital garden as a way to collect, manage and share information for people who don't want to depend on a social media company or maintain a blog.
