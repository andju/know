Stories mostly shortened and twisted over time, yet enticing with their veiled secrets. One such story is brought to us by the extinct settlement of P\u0159ibyslavice, located about two kilometers north of St\u0159\u00edbrn\u00e1 Skalica.</p> <p>Torso of buildings To date, only torso of brick buildings last inhabited during the Second World War have been preserved in P\u0159ibyslavice.</p> <p>Written sources We know roughly the following about the past of P\u0159ibyslavice (ie I am based on an article by S. Hendrychov\u00e1 published in S\u00e1zavsko No. 13, I only add my own findings in some places):</p> <ul> <li>1436 - they are the property of the S\u00e1zava Monastery (believes J. Kurka in his work from 1914 - Archdeaconry of Kou\u0159im, Boleslav, Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 and Litomy\u0161l Diocese)</li> <li>1525 - they are pledged to the lord of \u0160ellenberk, the holder of the Komorn\u00ed Hr\u00e1dek estate (the data comes from the chronicle of St\u0159\u00edbrn\u00e1 Skalica, which, however, as one of the oldest in the region began to appear at the beginning of the 18th century, ie 200 years later than the above )</li> <li>1557 - the first unquestionable mention of the village as part of the property of the Komorn\u00ed Hr\u00e1dek estate</li> <li>1654 - two farmers (Bern\u00ed rula) farm in P\u0159ibyslavice</li> <li>1697 - they become the property of the Kounice estate in the middle of the 18th century - one farmer farms in the village (Terezi\u00e1nsk\u00fd cadastre)</li> <li>1761 - Duchess Maria Theresa of Savoy buys the estate of Kounice and P\u0159ibyslavice and the village thus becomes part of the \u010cernokostelec estate, to which the town of Skalice has belonged since the 16th century, of which P\u0159ibyslavice became a part in the middle of the 19th century</li> <li>mid-19th century - farmed here in No. 82 J. Vysu\u0161il (information given in the Indication sketch - J. Wisuschil)</li> <li>2nd half of the 19th century - the Buri\u00e1nek family farms here. Sometimes during this period there is a complete reconstruction of the court, which is evident from the map of the stable cadastre from 1842, where the layout of buildings is completely different from the situation still preserved in the field and the situation recorded in the current cadastre (see plan at the end of the article). This change is also captured in the map of the land cadastre, where both the original state and the current state are visible. The reconstruction creates two descriptive numbers: no. 82 and no. 184.</li> <li>1900 - Suicide of Anton\u00edn Buri\u00e1nek, after which the Buri\u00e1nek family leaves P\u0159ibyslavice and the beginning of the decline of P\u0159ibyslavice as a peasant homestead begins. Part of the family of Anton\u00edn's brother Franti\u0161ek then appears in the village of Prusice, a few kilometers away, where he starts farming in No. 2. This is where my wife's mother, n\u00e9e Buri\u00e1nkov\u00e1, comes from. My wife and my children are descendants of the Buri\u00e1nky family from P\u0159ibyslavice. since the beginning of the 20th century, only forest and forest workers have lived here</li> <li>1906 - in no. 184 lives of V\u00e1clav Hir\u0161's family (until 1930)</li> <li>1922 - dies in no. 82 forest guard Josef Mal\u00edk</li> <li>1928 - no. 82 referred to as the princely grove - gamekeeper Alois Navr\u00e1til</li> <li>1928 - no. 184 referred to as the prince's house</li> <li>1931 - in no. 184 lives the family of Franti\u0161ek Pavel</li> <li>1932 - the last mention in the registers of no. 82 during World War II they live in P\u0159ibyslavice J\u00f3n</li> <li>1945 - Franti\u0161ek Kroupa dies - the last person with permanent residence in P\u0159ibyslavice, which does not mean that he actually had to live here</li> <li>today - property of the School Forest Enterprise with its registered office in Kostelec n. No. l.</li> </ul> <p>As can be seen from the list of data, we have not preserved much about this extinct medieval village, later the settlement and recently in solitude, so it is necessary to constantly remember these fragments. If you would like to learn more about P\u0159ibyslavice, get the publication S\u00e1zavsko number 13, where the above-mentioned article by Soni Hendrychov\u00e1 is published, or visit the current P\u0159ibyslavice straight away. One never knows whether he will see what he sees today in a few years. An example is the experience of the author of the article, who did the first prospection of P\u0159ibyslavice in 2006, when it could be noticed in the field disproportionately more than a year later, when the forest road passing through the settlement was extended from two to four meters and objects a year ago buried.</p>"}]}
